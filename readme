Install instructions tested on python3.12 and python3.14.

Install google chrome:
$ curl -LO https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
$ apt install -y ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

For handwriting recongition, create a file called 'gcv_api_key' with your
Google Cloud Vision API key in this directory.

We have to use the legacy pip resolver to ignore some dependency conflicts that
aren't actually conflicts.
$ python3 -m .venv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver -r requirements.txt

Now, let's run a test. Set up sync folder (in rm-viewer directory):
$ python3 -m rm_viewer syncd --install sync

follow instructions to do an initial scp into xochitl-dirty directory, and
start viewer.

to install on device, copy .rm-viewer template to another folder, and fill in
relevant fields in config.sh.

then scp onto device to /home/root/.rm-viewer
then run the following to make root and /etc writeable:
    umount -R /etc # unmount etc overlay
    mount -o remount,rw /  # mount system as writeable
then, in /home/root/.rm-viewer, run:
    ./install.sh

copy generated ssh key to remote.

then remount root as read only:
    mount -o remount,ro /
